## Water and Land Segmentation Using U-Net

<ul>
  <li>Developed a deep learning-based image segmentation system using the U-Net architecture to classify and differentiate between water bodies and land areas in satellite imagery.</li>
  <li>Preprocessed and labeled geospatial datasets to train and validate the U-Net model, ensuring accurate pixel-wise classification.</li>
  <li>Implemented convolutional neural networks using frameworks such as TensorFlow/Keras and PyTorch for training and inference.</li>
  <li>Used Python for data augmentation, preprocessing, and visualization of results using libraries like OpenCV, NumPy, and Matplotlib.</li>
  <li>Evaluated model performance using metrics such as IoU (Intersection over Union), accuracy, precision, and recall.</li>
  <li>Documented the process and outcomes for academic use and future extension into real-time GIS or drone-based systems.</li>
</ul>
